<p>However I also like making Video games, niche concepts, and making Music as well. Artworks can be found on the artworks page</p>

<p>I also work very well in the Computer Science Field and I hope to get into Cybersecurity field as well. Currently studying that up so that I can take after that in College at BYU</p>
<br>
<p>Currently I've studied Computers ever since the 3rd grade since my dad took me to a BYU coding camp, and I've loved it ever since. Video games are probably what made me realize I could do something with it</p>
